Atom syntax theme based on Tomorrow Night with darker background and more saturated colors. Somewhere between Tomorrow Dark and Tomorrow Night Bright.

Also includes tweaks for the Go programming language, using the same hues than the Monokai theme and also displaying variables with the default text color (syntax highlighting is nice but too much is just distracting).

The screenshots show examples for Go and Haskell.

Haskell:

This theme is based on Rocky Madden's [Tomorrow Night Eighties](https://atom.io/themes/tomorrow-night-eighties-syntax) syntax theme.

Original color palettes from Chris Kempson's [Tomorrow](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) theme.
