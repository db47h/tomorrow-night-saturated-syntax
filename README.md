# tomorrow-nightish-syntax theme

Configurable Atom syntax theme based on the Tomorrow Night colors.

The saturation of colors and the darkness of the background can be configured, allowing the user to get something between Tomorrow Dark and Tomorrow Night Bright.

Also includes tweaks for the Go programming language, using the same hues than the Monokai theme and also displaying variables with the default text color.

The screenshots show examples for Go and Haskell, with 6% darkening of background and colors saturated by 15%.
